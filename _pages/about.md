Hi! I am Hanjie, currently a Ph.D. student at Department of Media and Information at Michigan State University. My scholarly research interests lie in the areas of media, human-technology interaction, emotional effects, and psychological well-being. 

Specifically, my research addresses how individuals with different levels of mental disorders use social media and how they differ in their consumption of online information. I approach this work from an empirical social science perspective, primarily using quantitative survey and experimental designs. The primary aim of my research is to develop theoretical and practical knowledge regarding two challenges in social media and cyberpsychology: first, how to better assist individuals with mental disorders in computer-mediated communications on social media and, second, understanding roles that mood and emotions (particularly negative ones) play in online message consumption. 

My work has appeared in the annual conferences of National Communication Association (NCA), Association of Educators of Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC), International Conference on Research in Advertising (ICORIA), and Tobacco Regulatory Science Meeting (TRS).

In July 2021, I received my M.A. in Mass Communication from Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Minnesota.
